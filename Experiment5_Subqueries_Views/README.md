# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views
## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**

Write a SQL query to List departments with names longer than the average length

Departments Table
```
SELECT department_id,department_name
from Departments
WHERE LENGTH (department_name)>
(
SELECT AVG(LENGTH(department_name))
FROM Departments
)
```
**Output:**

**Question 2**

Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose salary is greater than $1500.

Sample table: CUSTOMERS

ID NAME AGE ADDRESS SALARY

1 Ramesh 32 Ahmedabad 2000 2 Khilan 25 Delhi 1500 3 Kaushik 23 Kota 2000 4 Chaitali 25 Mumbai 6500 5 Hardik 27 Bhopal 8500 6 Komal 22 Hyderabad 4500

7 Muffy 24 Indore 10000
```
SELECT * 
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY > 1500;
```

**Output:**

**Question 3**

Write a SQL query to Find employees who have an age less than the average age of employees with incomes over 2.5 Lakh
```
SELECT id,name,age,city,income
FROM Employee
WHERE age < (
    SELECT AVG(age)
    FROM Employee
    WHERE income > 250000
);
```

salesman_id numeric(5) name varchar(30) city varchar(15) commission decimal(5,2)

customer table

name type

customer_id int cust_name text city text grade int salesman_id int

```
SELECT s.salesman_id, s.name
FROM salesman s
JOIN customer c ON s.salesman_id = c.salesman_id
GROUP BY s.salesman_id, s.name
HAVING COUNT(c.customer_id) > 1;
```
